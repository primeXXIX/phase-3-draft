## Part 3: Web interface for grocery store

Create a front-end only site for an online grocery store where users can choose from a list of items and add them to a cart.

You only need to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No web server is required.

The initial layout has already been provided for you in the [grocer.html][grocer-html] and [grocer.css][grocer-css] files. From this base, build the modal and add interactive behavior with JS.

### Wireframe

Clicking on the "Cart" button opens the cart modal.
